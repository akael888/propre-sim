# ProPresenter Simulator // ProPre Sim

Link : [propre-sim.vercel.app](https://propre-sim.vercel.app)

## Background..

ProPresenter is the main tool used by my team to perform our Multimedia Church Service. However, we only have a single device installed with ProPresenter.

### Problem

Since we only have one device available, most of the time we're unable to execute our task in pararel.

### Solution

Since we used Text Based method (Notepad) within our workflow to import the text data into ProPresenter, it will increase our productivity to simulate the text results beforehand.

Therefore this ProPresenter Sim will offer that Simulation on a web app accessible anytime and anywhere, enabling all team member to foresee the ProPresenter Slide Results
