# ProPresenter Simulator // ProPre Sim

Link : [propre-sim.vercel.app](https://propre-sim.vercel.app)

## Background..

ProPresenter is the main tool used by my team to perform our Multimedia Church Service. However, we only have a single device installed with ProPresenter.

### Problem

Since we only have one device available, most of the time we were working on queue based approach. This slows down the process, since we couldn't execute our individual tasks in pararel

### Solution

Since we used Text Based method (Notepad) to import the slide data into ProPresenter, it will increase our productivity to simulate the text results beforehand.

Therefore this ProPresenter Sim offer that Simulation within a web app.
